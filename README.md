# Student Performance Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing student performance using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The project utilizes a dataset of student performance from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Student Performance" dataset, which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance). The dataset contains information about students' academic performance and demographic attributes. It includes various features such as:

- Student demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Family background and relationships
- Academic performance and grades
- Social and extracurricular activities
- Information about the school and teachers

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks with code and analysis of the dataset.
